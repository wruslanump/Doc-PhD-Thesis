\noindent
Acknowledging that the trend in CNC machining is toward NURBS curves, this paper presents the realtime interpolation of a class of NURBS curve which is inherently parametric. Ten different 2-dimensional NURBS curves were selected based on varying features, shapes and dimensions. The curve characteristics cover variations, in size of x and y dimensions, of origin or not-origin centered, of closed or open ended curves, with different number of loops, with convex or concave segments, with sharp or smooth turns, and different reflection symmetry about the x and y axes.\\

\noindent
The realtime interpolation algorithm when applied to all of the selected curves exclusively and simultaneously satisfy both of its designed constraints, that covers, its feedrate and its chord-error tolerance. The resulting feedrate profiles throughout the entire path of the curves are continuous and smooth. The feedrate constraints comprise dynamic equations for allowable CNC machine parameters like the maximum and minimum axial velocities, and the maximum and minimum axial accelerations. The chord-error constraints comprise geometric and kinematic properties of the ten(10) different parametric curves, like bends and sharp turns. The resulting algorithm can be executed both in a realtime, online mode by driving the CNC machine directly, or in an offline mode by using a stored RS274/NGC G-code file.
